# Exploiters

Exploiters are Infection Monkey plugins that attempt to infect machines
throughout the network by spreading copies of the Agent.

##

During an attack, the exploitation phase is when attackers carry out chosen
exploitation techniques to compromise the network after identifying specific
vulnerabilities in the environment through reconnaissance and scanning. By
leveraging these vulnerabilities, attackers are able to gain unauthorized access
to systems, escalate privileges, or execute malicious actions.

Infection Monkey has several exploiters that mimic real-world attack vectors.
To the best of our knowledge, most of these exploiters pose no risk to
performance or services on victim machines. Exploiters that could adversely
impact production workloads are clearly marked as "unsafe" in the Monkey Island.
