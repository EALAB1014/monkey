# Exploiters

Exploiters are Infection Monkey plugins that attempt to infect machines
throughout the network by spreading copies of the Agent.

## Mimicking attackers

During an attack, the exploitation phase is when attackers carry out chosen
exploitation techniques to compromise the network after identifying specific
vulnerabilities in the environment through reconnaissance and scanning. By
leveraging these vulnerabilities, attackers are able to gain unauthorized access
to systems, escalate privileges, or execute malicious actions.

## How exploiters work

In an Infection Monkey Agent's lifecycle, after the reconnaissance phase comes
the exploitation phase. In this phase, the Agent attempts to exploit as many
systems in the network as possible by using the enabled exploiters. Once a
machine is exploited, propagation takes place, that is, a new Agent is copied
to the machine and run.

Infection Monkey has several exploiters that mimic real-world attack vectors.
Some exploiters are based on vulnerabilities while others use brute-force
tactics to gain access. To the best of our knowledge, most of these exploiters
pose no risk to performance or services on victim machines. Exploiters that
could adversely impact production workloads are clearly marked as "unsafe" in
the Monkey Island.
