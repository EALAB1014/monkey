# Exploiters

##

In a network breach, the exploitation phase is a critical stage where attackers
identify specific vulnerabilities in the environment through reconnaissance and
scanning, and accordingly select appropriate exploitation techniques to
compromise the network. By leveraging these vulnerabilities, attackers are able
to gain unauthorized access to systems, escalate privileges, or execute
malicious actions.

Infection Monkey has several exploiters that mimic real-world attack vectors.
To the best of our knowledge, most of these exploiters pose no risk to
performance or services on victim machines. The potentially harmful ones are
clearly marked as "unsafe" in the Monkey Island.
