The SNMP exploiter exploits [CVE-2020-15862](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15862).


### Description

If a community is configured with read-write access, the machine is vulnerable to an attack using NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB to run arbitrary commands on the victim.

In versions 1 and 2c of the SNMP protocol the only means of authentication is the community string. In these versions of SNMP, community strings are sent as plaintext in all requests. Version 3 adds user-based authentication and encryption to the SNMP protocol.

This exploiter uses version 2c of the SNMP protocol. It brute-forces machines by using usernames and passwords provided by the user (see [configuration](/usage/configuration) for instructions) as SNMP community strings.
