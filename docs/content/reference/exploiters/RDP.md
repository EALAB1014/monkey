### Description

This exploiter uses brute force to propagate through the network via Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP). For more information about RDP, see [Microsoft's
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/termserv/remote-desktop-protocol).


#### Credentials used

The RDP exploiter can be run from both Linux and Windows attackers and will
use configured or stolen credentials to propagate. Different combinations of
credentials are attempted in the following order:

1. **Brute force usernames and passwords** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames and passwords that were set in the
   [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials) or stolen by
   a credentials collector.


1. **Brute force usernames and NT hashes** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames and NT Hashes that were set in the
   [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials) or stolen by a credentials
   collector.

   This only works on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. You can read more
