## Configuration

<!--
This documentation was autogenerated by passing the plugin's config-schema.json
through https://github.com/adobe/jsonschema2md. It was then modified by hand to

## Order of credentials used for brute-forcing

The PowerShell exploiter can be run from both Linux and Windows attackers. On
Windows attackers, the exploiter has the ability to use the cached username
and/or password from the current user. On both Linux and Windows attackers, the
exploiter uses all combinations of the [user-configured usernames and
passwords](/usage/configuration/credentials), as well as LM or NT hashes that
have been collected. Different combinations of credentials are attempted in the
following order:

1. **Cached username and password (Windows attacker only)** - The exploiter
   will use the stored credentials of the current user to attempt to log into
   the victim machine.

1. **Brute force usernames with blank passwords** - Windows allows you to
   configure a user with a blank/empty password. The exploiter will attempt to
   log into the victim machine using each username set in the
   [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials) with a
   blank password.

   In order for the attacker to connect with a blank password, the victim must
   have enabled basic authentication, http and no encryption.

1. **Brute force usernames with cached password (Windows attacker only)** - The
   exploiter will attempt to log into the victim machine using each username
   set in the [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials) and the current
   user's cached password.

1. **Brute force usernames and passwords** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames and passwords that were set in the
   [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials).

1. **Brute force usernames and LM hashes** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames that were set in the
   [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials) and LM hashes that were
   collected from any other victims.

1. **Brute force usernames and NT hashes** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames that were set in the
   [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials) and NT hashes that were
   collected from any other victims.
