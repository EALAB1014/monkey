## Configuration

<!--
This documentation was autogenerated by passing the plugin's config-schema.json
through https://github.com/adobe/jsonschema2md. It was then modified by hand to
remove extraneous information.

## Order of credentials used for brute-forcing

The RDP exploiter can be run from both Linux and Windows attackers and will
use configured or stolen credentials to propagate. Different combinations of
credentials are attempted in the following order:

1. **Brute force usernames and passwords** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames and passwords that were set in the
   [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials) or stolen by
   a credentials collector.

1. **Brute force usernames and NT hashes** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames and NT Hashes that were set in the
   [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials) or stolen by a credentials
   collector.

   This only works on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. More information
   is available [here](https://www.kali.org/blog/passing-hash-remote-desktop/).
