## Configuration

<!--
This documentation was autogenerated by passing the plugin's config-schema.json
through https://github.com/adobe/jsonschema2md. It was then modified by hand to

## ???

If a community is configured with read-write access, the machine is vulnerable
to an attack using NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB to run arbitrary commands on the victim.

In versions 1 and 2c of the SNMP protocol the only means of authentication is
the community string. In these versions of SNMP, community strings are sent as
plaintext in all requests. Version 3 adds user-based authentication and
encryption to the SNMP protocol.

This exploiter uses version 2c of the SNMP protocol. It brute-forces machines
by using usernames and passwords provided by the user (see [configuration
](/usage/configuration) for instructions) as SNMP community strings.
